# Carbon-Footprints

Introduction

Knowing your carbon footprint is critical to understanding your impact on the planet and yet there still seems to be some confusion over what it means. A carbon footprint is a certain amount of gaseous emissions that are relevant to climate change and associated with human production or consumption activities. It is an environmental indicator of the volume of greenhouse gases — those gases in our atmosphere that trap and release heat and contribute to climate change. Offsetting the carbon emissions from your lifestyle is a critical step toward fighting climate change.

Humanity’s global carbon footprint is the headline index for climate change. The carbon footprint has been on a soaring trend in the 21st century, with the exception of a brief drop in 2020 because of the COVID-19 lockdown. So, how do we reduce our impact on the Earth?

Individual action on climate change begins from their choices in many areas, such as diet, travel, household energy use, consumption of goods and services, and family size. High-consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact, with the richest 10% of people emitting about half the total lifestyle emissions. People who wish to reduce their carbon footprint can take high-impact actions, such as avoiding frequent flying and petrol-fuelled cars, eating a plant-based diet, and avoiding meat and dairy foods. They can engage in local and political advocacy around issues of climate change.

This project is an endeavor to support the cause by providing an approximate of the carbon footprints you generate in your day-to-day activities. It tries to explain the bleak consequence and suggests ways to transform it into a productive influence. Other important factors are endorsed in the imminent pages. This is an elementary version of a product that may take future turns with more details and scientific research along with a user-preferred interface.

"We're running the most dangerous experiment in history right now, which is to see how much carbon dioxide the atmosphere can handle before there is an environmental catastrophe."

Working Rule

GHG emissions are most likely made up of the energy used for electricity and travel, in addition to the energy required to produce food and all the other stuff you buy. These are called direct emissions however, the true carbon footprint of something would take into account all of the indirect emissions of a product, such as the extraction and processing of oil used in manufacture and transport. 

Though the entire lifetime’s value of emissions should be taken into account, this project report deals on a very small scale and provides a rough estimate of their carbon footprints to an ordinary user. If it is meant to be considered for any scientific research, modifications may be included in future developments. 

The data used here is obtained from several websites which are cited with the data. 

The activities which are examined in the report are as mentioned :
Browsing Internet
Commuting and traveling
Data Storage
Creating Non-Recycled Waste
Energy Consumption at Home or Workplace
Using a Smartphone

Takes necessary data from the user using a Tkinter application.

Performs calculations as specified in the Python code to find the weight of carbon footprints (in kgs) and number of trees.

Stores the data in an SQL Database and displays the carbon footprints, number of trees, and ways to reduce the carbon footprints.

Features

An app designed to calculate your carbon footprints generated during daily activities : browsing the internet, commuting and traveling, data storage, creating nonrecycled waste, energy consumption at home or workplace, and using a smartphone)

backend made using Python SQL Connectivity and frontend with Tkinter application

- gives you an estimate of the weight of carbon footprints you produce.
- displays the number of trees you owe to the planet while performing daily activities.
- allows you to display the stored data (along with the time of measurement), insert data, update previous records, search for an entry, and delete the stored info. with every command, shows you the total carbon footprints and the number of trees owing within an instant.
- shows ways to reduce your carbon footprints.
- reminds you of your responsibility to the Earth

future projections

- a more accurate calculation of the carbon footprints with reference to various parameters associated with the task.
- a method to share your progress with others and create impact.
- a more simplified version of it that seems more appealing and easy to interface.

"There is no footprint so small that it can not leave an impact on the planet."
